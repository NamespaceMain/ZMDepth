# ZMDepth
We present the first monocular fisheye camera depth estimation dataset for parking lot scenes, called ZMDepth.

# Dataset overview
Our dataset is captured by driving in numerous parking lots in a large-size city. It contains over 80,000 depth maps in total. In order to encourage further research, we will initially release a partial dataset after privacy anonymization for the benefit of the community. It covers all four surround-view fisheye cameras.
